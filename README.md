## getting started
Have no Idea about hacktober fest? Do not know about Git/Github ? Want to know more about Code-Forge Repository or Hacktoberfest? 

Check-Out Our Getting Started Guide
[ here](https://dev.to/kappuccino111/iit-mandi-students-lets-fortify-our-opensource-armour-together-opd)

Here you will get everything you need for getting started in your open source journey.

## Description 📚 
 <!-- * ##  3 Folders 
 * #### Folder 1 : Data Structure and Algorithms
            
            this folder contains basic code for the given data structure 
            for example: ConvexHull Algorithms
 * #### Folder 2 : Machine Learning Algorithms
            
            this folder contains basic code for the ML algorithm
* #### Folder 3 : Applications Folder
            
            this folder is subdivided into 2 subfolders
* #### folder 3A : DSA Applications
        
            this folder contains Applications of the  data structure

<!-- ## Description 📚 -->

- **3 Folders**
  - **Folder 1: Data Structures and Algorithms**
    - Contains basic code for various data structures, such as Convex Hull Algorithms.
  - **Folder 2: Machine Learning Algorithms**
    - Contains basic code for machine learning algorithms.
  - **Folder 3: Applications Folder**
    - This folder is subdivided into two subfolders:
      - **Folder 3A: DSA Applications**
        - Contains applications of the data structures.
      - **Folder 3B: ML Applications**
        - Contains applications of machine learning algorithms.

 * ## Tasks ✅
        You have to make PR's for the basic codes of Computational/ML Algorithmis (in 
        Folder 1/ Folder 2) and the Application based on the algorithm that you have 
        provided (in Folder1/Folder2) in subfolders (Folder3A/Folder3B) in Folder3.

        Only 2 PRs for Computational/ML Algorithmic contributions will be 
        accepted and the rest 2 should be for applications based on the algorithms.
